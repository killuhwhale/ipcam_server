React 18 conflict

Might need to add --legacy-peer-deps to all commands for NPM install on package.json 

npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled --legacy-peer-deps
npm install @mui/icons-material --legacy-peer-deps







TODO


Video record length is spotty

The record process is listening for other stuff
 maybe if we spawn a separate process to run the recording, it will be much more accurate...

OR

Motion class is sending too many motion



Need to split up Motion Recording and ManualRecording.
It doesnt really work well together
